# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The client, Dana, has asked for further in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing a user to filter multiple criteria at the same time.  The filters will include the date, city, state, country, and shape.  To accomplish this, use of JavaScript and HTML will be implemented.  Each code will be refactored to ensure that the website will feature the new filters asked by the client.   
## Results: 
alt txt!()

A user now has option to search through filters.  If a user wants to look for sightings in Sacramento, CA, the user would input sacramento(Enter City) and ca(Enter State) into associated filter. The image below shows the user input and the results. 

alt txt!()


The filter search does not need to include other fields to be used.  The website takes the user input and searches the data for user's input. 


## Summary: 

## Drawback/Issues
The drawback to design for the website is that user input must be exact.  If a user did not type in lower case for city, a result would not show.  This input field of filter of shape also may cause some issues because the must be exact.

## Recommendations

1. A range of dates could help improve the website.  A user could investigate a month, week, or another range of dates.  Currently user can only select one day as input for the day filter. 

2.  A new code (JavaScript or CSS) should be used to counter any user errors or syntaxes such as upper-case letters.  This code would ensure that user will still receive a result.
